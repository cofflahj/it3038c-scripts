# Here is how you can run a Powershell script that I created, which uses a plugin called PSWindowsUpdate. To install this plugin to your system, first do the following:
# This script can be used to manage your windows update files and installs on your device or amongst mulitple devices on a network if you choose to do so. However, in the instances below it will only take actions on your own device.
# All scripts have been individually included within the Lab 7 repository.

Install-Module -Name PSWindowsUpdate

# Then, you can import the moduel to the PS session dependent upon if you downloaded the plugin from the console or manually. This will ensure the moduel is loaded / imported.

Import-Module PSWindowsUpdate

# To check the list of currently installed updates, or names of updates along with their status or completion you can do:

Get-WUHistory

# Moreover, you can further check installation dates and details by:

Get-WUHistory | Where-Object {$_.Title -match "KB4489*"} | Select-Object *|ft

# Then, if you require an additional update install or are planning to install one anyways, you can do:

Get-WUInstall -KBArticleID KB4489883,KB4489883 -AcceptAll
# You will have to interchange the KB #'s with the specific update you'd like to have installed.

# Finally, if you go through the update history list and notice either updates you don't want to view such as aborted and failed, you can put them on a hidden list by:

$HideList = "KB4489873", "KB4489883"
Hide-WindowsUpdate -KBArticleID $HideList -Hide
# Like the previous commands, you will need to interchange the KB #'s to the one(s) you'd like to hide.


# Overall, these are fairly simple and efficient tools included within this plugin that can help you manage your windows updates right through the Powershell console. Hopefully, this can make things extremely easier than navigating through the GUI and control panel. Moreover, it allows you to view additional information that might now be provided through the GUI so this can be used to benefit some users.
